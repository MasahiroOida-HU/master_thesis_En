\section{Results and Outlook}
    This is the $p_T$ spectrum of the yield for $\omega$ and $\phi$. Since the cross section has not been calculated for the vertical axis yet, a comparison with other experimental results cannot be made. However, a distribution with an exponential dependence on $p_T$ can be observed.

    As for future prospects, simulations of $\omega \rightarrow \mu\mu$ and $\phi \rightarrow \mu\mu$ will be conducted, followed by acceptance $\times$ efficiency corrections. The goal is to determine the production cross-section for $\omega$ and $\phi$ in forward muon pairs.
